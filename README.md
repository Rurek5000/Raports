## About
The assumption of the application was to make the data reporting process more pleasant.
The personal trainer for whom the application was created kept the data of his charges in separate sheets and worked on them (he had additional tools to calculate various parameters there).

Each sheet has an appropriate ID, which is given in the URL.
Without this id the form will return an error.
The data is validated on the html side (appropriate attributes for input), javascript frontend and javascript backend.

## Technologies
* HTML
* Sass
* JavaScript
* Express.js
